			<p>I started my academic career at West City Exceptional Child Learning Center and I had a amazing experience over there. My elementary school taught me a lot of things especially academically. Though my grades weren't the best, I still had the best time over there.
				<br><br>
				When I finished elemtary I had no doubts on going to science high becase I knew i belonged here (crazy) which I kinda regret but its gonna be okay. My grades in the 7th-8th grade were not that good but it got me through. Now im in the 9th grade passing my subjects with flying colors!! 
				<br><br>
				Im still not sure about the future but I will take every opportunity the Lord will give me.

				LABYU SIR UNTA MAKA PASAR KO HEHE</p>
